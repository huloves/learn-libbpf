	 * representation:

	 * If BTF data is later modified, e.g., due to types added or
	 * removed, BTF deduplication performed, etc, this contiguous
	 * representation is broken up into three independently allocated
	 * memory regions to be able to modify them independently.
	 * raw_data is nulled out at that point, but can be later allocated
	 * and cached again if user calls btf__raw_data(), at which point
	 * raw_data will contain a contiguous copy of header, types, and
	 * strings:

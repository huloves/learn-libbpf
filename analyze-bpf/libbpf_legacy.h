/**
 * @brief **libbpf_get_error()** extracts the error code from the passed
 * pointer
 * @param ptr pointer returned from libbpf API function
 * @return error code; or 0 if no error occured
 *
 * Note, as of libbpf 1.0 this function is not necessary and not recommended
 * to be used. Libbpf doesn't return error code embedded into the pointer
 * itself. Instead, NULL is returned on error and error code is passed through
 * thread-local errno variable. **libbpf_get_error()** is just returning -errno
 * value if it receives NULL, which is correct only if errno hasn't been
 * modified between libbpf API call and corresponding **libbpf_get_error()**
 * call. Prefer to check return for NULL and use errno directly.
 *
 * This API is left in libbpf 1.0 to allow applications that were 1.0-ready
 * before final libbpf 1.0 without needing to change them.
